# Automated-Risk-Assessment-Generator
This is a project I created to allow teachers at our school to automatically create risk assessments and other resources for planning educational visits using Google Apps Script.
It will: 
- create a risk assessment from a template (Google Doc)
- create a letter for parents (Google Doc)
- create a dinner request form for kitchen staff (Google Doc)
- create an all day event in a (shared) Google Calendar
- create a draft email to relevant teachers including the links to the Docs (Gmail)
